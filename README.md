**Summary:** In this work, we trained 11 patch classifiers for the Cancer vs Normal task on 11 different cancer types. Then we perform cross inference. Further we use each of these classifiers to generate RoIs using GradCAM and measure overlap with respct to the model trained on each cancer type. Furthermore, we study the similarities in the histograms of geometric features within these RoIs to enhance this understanding even more.
